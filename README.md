# movies_recommendation_systems
Creating two movies recommendation systems. 
The first one is based on a previous movie that you have already watched, the algorithm calculates the cosine similarity from the vector of the movie the user enters to the rest of the movies in the data base. The result is a list that starts with the most similar movie to the one entered by the user. 
The second algorithm uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to predict the movie a user will like to watch based on information entered by him. The outcome is a simgle movie predicted by the model.
In both cases the system uses to predict the movie: 1-Genres, 2-Keywords, 3-Cast, 4-Director.
